PIMA Indians Diabetes data 

Pregnancies - Number of times pregnant
Glucose Plasma - Glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure - Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
Skin Thickness -Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin2 - Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI - Body mass index (weight in kg/height in m)^2)
Diabetes - Pedigree function diabetes pedigree function

Total - 768 patients details

Dataset describes the patients undergoing pregnancy will get gestation diabetes or not. 
The dataset already has Outcomes whether the patients will get diabetes or not classified into 0 and 1

Now, we shall get a good grab on how the Machine learning algorithms works by applying all the classifier's to predict 
which Model can predict better results against the Outcomes/ Target data given.
